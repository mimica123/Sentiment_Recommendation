    "# Cleaning Step\n",
    "In this file, the task is to clean all images in order to have them ready for inputing them in the Convolutional Neural Network. The first step is to change the name of all the images in each of the folders created for each emotion: happy, sad, angy, fear and disgust. Then images need to have the same size for matching the entry of the Convolutional Neural Network. In this particular case the input of the images size will be 48 by 48, which means the height will be 48 and the width will be 48 also. To avoid future problems with images, the raw images will be conserved in their respective classification folders and new ones will be created for each of the emotions with the new names and sizes. Also, the data will be split in train and test to have it ready for the Convolutional Neural Network step in future files.\n",

To achieve this the function Change_Name is needed. Importing this function from the file Definitions.py which contains all the functions we are going to use for this project, so it is important to not forget to import it at the beginning of our code."
